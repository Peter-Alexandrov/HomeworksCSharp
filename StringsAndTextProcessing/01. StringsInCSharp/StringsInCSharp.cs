         //2) string.Contains(): Returns a value indicating whether a specified substring occurs within this string.
         //3) string.IndexOf(): Reports the zero-based index of the first occurrence of the specified Unicode character in this string or specified string in this instance.
         //4) string.Split(): Returns a string array that contains the substrings, that are delimited by elements of a specified Unicode character array or string array.
         //5) string.Substring(): Retrieves a substring from this instance. The substring starts at a specified character position and continues to the end of the string or a specified length.
